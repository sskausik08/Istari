\begin{theorem}
Given a topology $T = (R, L)$, the ARC, the set of  
traffic characteristics $\{tc \in TC | tc \in IP \times R \times R \times \nat\}$ and 
$(L_f, \fail)$ where $L_f \subseteq L$ denotes the subset of links 
which can potentially fail and $\fail$ denotes the number of links which have failed,
the problem of finding a set of links $\links \subseteq L_f$ such that $|\links| = \fail$
and there exists a link $l \in L \setminus \links$ where the sum of flows exceeds capacity of the link $l$
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We show that the Hamiltonian path problem, which is NP-complete reduces to the
quantitative verification problem under failures. The latter is also in NP, so after the reduction we 
 can conclude that it is also NP-complete.
 
\end{proof}
